# Longest Path in a Weighted Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)
## Problem Statement

You are given a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) with `n` nodes, numbered from `0` to `n-1`. The graph is represented as an adjacency list where `graph[i]` is a list of tuples `(j, w)`, representing an edge from node `i` to node `j` with weight `w`. Your task is to find the longest path in the graph starting from any node.

- **Function Signature:**
  ```python
  def longest_path(graph: list) -> int:

**Parameters:**
    graph (list): A list of lists, where graph[i] contains tuples (j, w) representing an edge from node i to node j with weight w.

    Returns:
        int: The length of the longest path in the graph.

#Example

    Input:

graph = [
    [(1, 3), (2, 2)],
    [(3, 4)],
    [(3, 1)],
    []
]

Output:

7

Explanation:
The longest path is from node 0 -> node 1 -> node 3 with a total weight of 3 + 4 = 7.
